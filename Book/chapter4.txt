# Advanced debugging tools

Visual C++'s debugger offers a great experience out of the box. The compiler, the debugger and the user interface are very well integrated. It's very easy to get started and debug programs. However, what a developer typically uses is just the tip of the iceberg. Many advanced debugging tools are hidden and/or undocumented. In this section, we will show you these hidden tools and how to use them. Your productivity when debugging issues will increase significantly, and it will make bugs that were hard to investigate much more approachable.

Let's start with my favorite advanced tools: advanced breakpoints.

## Advanced breakpoints

We won't cover basic breakpoints usage in this section, but just to make sure that we're on the same page, let's quickly review how to use them.

In order to set a breakpoint with Visual C++ 2013, load the [sample solution](http://bit.ly/1jOmGN9) and set the project named _Breakpoints_ as the startup project.
