-# Advanced debugging tools

Visual C++'s debugger offers a great experience out of the box. The compiler,
the debugger and the user interface are very well integrated. It's very easy
to get started and debug programs. However, what a developer typically uses is
just the tip of the iceberg. Many advanced debugging tools are hidden and/or
undocumented. In this section, we will show you these hidden tools and how to
use them. Your productivity when debugging issues will increase significantly,
and it will make bugs that were hard to investigate much more approachable.

Whenever possible, implementation details of the debugger's internals will be
presented. These details are both useful to know when solving issues requiring
low-level skills and fun to learn.

Let's start with one of my favorite advanced debugging tools: advanced
breakpoints.
