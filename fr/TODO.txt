Top priority:
-------------
* Add .gitignore for Visual Studio solution's temp files, and commit + push latest changes.
* Add new project /d2Zi+ to demo undocumented option /d2Zi+.
* Add two method calls to the "CallingConventions" project, one with the "__thiscall" calling convention set
explicitely and the other with no attribute, show how the __thiscall convention uses ECX to store the this 
pointer and how it's used as the default calling convention. Change one of the method calls to use __cdecl or __stdcall and show where the "this pointer is stored".
* Add a project example to illustrate how Edit & Continue works.
* Illustrate with a source code example the additional MOV instructions that are generated by unoptimized compilation to make the watch window "work".
